### 4. Roadies
Justin Oshea and Ken Silver must be having flashbacks to last season. The Roadies were flat out awful on Sunday and it started with Justin and Ken.
Kens time at quarterback can only be described as a complete failure and Justin’s time at quarterback was also horrible at best. Nick Delmonte and Coach Nick Muse seemed to be afterthoughts in the teams boring snoozer of an offense.
This is not what we’ve come to expect of a Shoe led team. Always upbeat, encouraging, engaged, and organized, The Coach seemed checked out.
The Roadies zone defense was also a complete joke. I’ve never seen a Roadies team in this kind of disarray. It may be time for a roster shake up.

### 3. Drivers
Only Colin Tully today. He played well and had some big moments. We saw things we’ve all come to expect out of the former MVP. The burning question is, will we see any other members of this team anytime soon?
We know Ian Tully was unavailable today because of a scheduled Covid booster vaccine.
But Ian and Colin need to see something out of 3rd round pick Joe Labo. We all know what the Hall Of Famer is capable of but seeing is believing in this league.

### 2. MothMen 
Sorry MothMen, Sorry Coach Holmes. I clearly underrated this roster last week. It’s hard to even pick a player to start with as all 6 players shined all day. Let’s start with the tale of 2 Matts. 
Matt Warner had 2 big grabs and helped lead the way for the MothMen rushing attack. Matt King (Rookie) was explosive on both sides of the ball. A true deep threat, Matt King can stretch the field and be featured as a lead ball carrier. 
Maca was Maca. I’ve already touched on just how impressed I’ve been with John Maca but he continued to add to his resume beating Justin Oshea twice on deep shots. 
Renzo is going to make a strong case for his 2nd MVP award this season. He was outrageous on Sunday. He can make any throw. He can fit the ball into the tiniest of windows. Most impressively, he has full control of this MothMen offense. 
I love what Coach Holmes learned from his time playing along side Frank Semisa, He’s practicing winning tendencies and building a winning culture.

### 1. Smokes
In the round robin portion of Sunday’s scrimmage action the Smokes were nearly perfect. They allowed only 2 scores and failed to score only twice. 2 interceptions by Jesus Arancibia and multiple turn overs on downs set the Smokes up with favorable field position all day.
We all expected Frank and JJ to be a force but it was JJs defense that impressed Semisa early. Big break ups on both Justin and Delmonte helped to force punts.
Dingo was Franks security blanket all day. He seems to thrive in finding the space against zone coverage. Dingos role as the center in Semisa’s offense will give him an opportunity to pile up catches and that’s exactly what he did.
Nick Geraci stood out as the vertical threat in this offense. His 2 scores were impressive but QB Frank Semisa loved what he saw out of Geraci on defense. “He’s not afraid to stick his nose in there” said Semisa.
Frank Semisa may not have Renzo’s arm, but he’s still the best signal caller in the game. His offense was dynamic and multiple. He makes the game look easy and I think it underrates him as a passer. He doesn’t have to make the tough tight throws and that’s exactly how he wants it. If Frank continues to keep defenses off balance he could be getting fitted for his 8th ring.

### Stock up.
The good Ole coach

He took shit for each pick on draft night but he had a plan and executed that plan. It’s paying off. Makes you think about how different last year’s championship game could have been had both Renzo and Dingo been healthy. 

### Stock down
The Roadies QB conundrum

It can’t be Ken, It shouldn’t be Justin. I don’t know who it’s going to be but I can promise you it’s going to be ugly. Both Ken and Justin threw interceptions and had it not been for Colin Tully (who isn’t a member of the Roadies) this offense would have been scoreless.
