### Smith's Point Captains
Team Johnny has the most talent 1 through 6 of all 4 rosters. They have 2 guys in both Colin Tully and MikeC who have started multiple games at QB. Colin Tully’s 2013 MVP QB performance should give him the starting not going into training camp. Outside you have Nick Delmonte, A premier deep threat in this league and opposite him you have Steve N who is a great possession receiver. In the middle you have 2 first down getters in Tyler and Coach Johnny. I think this team has all the talent on paper, the questions will be how Johnny plans to put his player in the best position to win.

### Shirley Estate Mothmanian Devils
While I believe Team Shoe/Esco has more talent overall from top to bottom, The combination of Frank Semisa and Justin Oshea can not be overlooked. The 2 men have 10 total rings and 4 total MVP awards. They can make up for the deficiencies on this roster and will have to. Outside of them you have Mr.Nino who should thrive in Semisa’s run first offense. This team also features Ken silver who has won 2 rings with Frank and Justin and also won the 2016 Center/Tight-end award. Josh P had a solid rookie year on the offensive side of the ball but he and Holmes will have to improve on defense for this team to have a legit shot this season

### Neighborhood Roadies
As I said, I believe this roster has more talent that Team Holmes. But there are a lot of unanswered questions. Who is this teams starting QB? Ian Tully? (2015 MVP) Nick Geraci? I love what the team has done at receiver. Maca is a star and is still somehow UNDERrated. Nick Muse provides a solid underneath option and Esco can be used at almost any pass catching position on this team. Dingo is an intriguing option for slot receiver. While he doesn’t have elite speed, his short area quickness and burst get him plenty of separation against man to man defense. Team Shoe/Esco can move to the 2 spot with a solid Pre-Season of football.

### Poospatuck Smokes
This is not me hating on Team Dan. This team has talent. This team has last years MVP in Renzo. This team was last year’s champions! The question is, will the loss of the outside speed that both Ian and Wes offered hurt this team? Joe Labo is a great addition. A 4 time champion with experience at nearly every position is always a good thing to have. Ray is Ray. You can’t ignore him or he’ll burn you. We no what Renzo is capable of after a historic performance last year. But I question the bottom half of this roster. JohnA has been solid for years but still has yet to win a championship. After a solid day last year can Dan Oshea improve to become the 3rd option this team desperately needs in the passing game? And can Marc register his first ever catch? To many questions for now.
