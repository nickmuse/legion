### Shirley Estate Mothmanian Devils
TeamHolmes continues to to show up to scrimmages in great numbers. This team has not had a single scrimmage with less than 4 players. Today we saw a lot of Frank Semisa at QB (As expected) and he played great. The team did not stall on a single drive. They scored on every single possession. Frank was calm and and accurate all day. His quick release kept the defense off balance and on their heels. His chemistry with Justin Oshea was on full display. The two connected for a couple of scores and a ton a first down yardage. But it’s officially time to start recognizing what Ken Silver is doing this Pre-Season. He’s been a matchup nightmare for opposing defenders. He’s got great size and deceptive speed. But his best attribute is his catch radius. He’s the 2nd option that this team NEEDED so desperately to compliment Justin. With Ken and Justin playing at a high level this team could be destined for greatness.

### Neighborhood Roadies
TeamShoeEsco has had strong numbers at this year’s scrimmages. Today Coach Nick played a decent amount with Frank Semisa as his QB and Nick truly shined in Franks “Quick hit” offense. Geraci also played well in Franks system but the key for these 2 players moving forward will be the chemistry they build together. If Geraci wants to solidify himself as this teams starting QB, it will be up to him to create an offense that can get Nick Muse an opportunity to operate in space (Where he is at his best). Maca had another strong outing. We still have yet to see this teams 1st round pick Ian Tully. Ian can make or break this team and we need to see exactly how he fits in before this team can secure the number 1 spot. 

### Smith Point Captains
Today we saw zero players from TeamJohnny. Since the draft we have seen only one player from TeamJohnny at a scrimmage this year. I sound like a broken record when I talk about all the talent this team has but unfortunately talent can only take them so far. I thought TeamJohnny was more talented than TeamDan in last years final but the lack of 
continuity showed. Johnny has to get this team on the same page and he has to do it soon. 

### Poospatuck Smokes
TeamDan had a full 5 man team show up at today’s scrimmage. QB renzo looked sharp at times. But the offense as a whole seemed to struggle to pick up 1st downs. Joe Labo (The teams 1st round pick) injured his leg. This is incredibly concerning. He’s technically this teams speed threat and the team can’t afford to get any slower on the outside. JohnAy looked solid as a pass catcher and even had a few great throws in limited action at QB. The big surprise of the day was Marc. Say what you will, the guy had some catches including a HUGE first down grab over the middle. A 50/50 ball, contested, bobbled, and hauled in. Marc could be a dangerous red zone threat for this team.
