## Building the Ultimate LOL Reciever

I’ve created the perfect L.O.L. pass catcher using these 10 metrics.

Take a look at who’s the best at what they do.

### 1. Speed

#### Ian Tully

Speed kills in all sports and Ian Tully has been L.O.L.'s premier speed threat for 13 years. The Hall of Famer doesn't just beat you vertically, he uses his speed to beat you from sideline to sideline as well. It's his speed that usually makes defenders think twice about how much cushion to give Ian. It's the same speed that makes Ian one of the most dangerous threats on wide receiver screens and end arounds.

*Honorable Mention: Wes Sullivan*

###  2. Physicality

#### John Maca

Getting physical at the point of attack is rare for receivers in this league. Most players try to win with speed or scheme. John Maca isn’t afraid to jostle for position and use his hands and strength to brush off defenders. It’s not just his way of winning off of the line of scrimmage, Maca uses his physical traits to win contested 50/50 balls as well. He doesn't just use his physical hands to create separation but he used those strong hands to win contested catches. That physicality also makes Maca a top blocking receiver in the run game.

*Honorable mention: Matt King*

### 3. Run After Catch

#### Colin Tully

Colin turns grown men into children once he’s made the catch. He straight up embarrasses people. He possesses elite change of direction skills and a rare ability to stop on a dime.  Couple his shiftiness with his elite speed and you have a recipe for highlight reels. After Colin makes the catch you can usually find a trail of downed defenders picking themselves up off of the turf.

*Honorable mention: Evan Meinke*

### 4. Deep Ball Tracking

#### Nick Delmonte

At his top end, Delmonte has "Tully" level speed which has helped to make him one of the premier deep threats in this league. But it’s his ball tracking that makes him so dangerous. He tracked a deep ball in last year's 1st round game against the Roadies that led him directly into the fence, and he STILL game down with the touchdown grab. When getting behind a defense is your specialty, deep ball tracking is the most important skill to have, and Delmonte has made a career out of it.

*Honorable mention: James McDermott*

### 5. Size

#### Justin O'Shea

Let me be clear. "Size" is not about height or body type. It’s a style. For me size includes many factors. 

- High pointing the 50/50 balls

- Ability to use basketball skills to box out defenders

- Effectively using your wingspan to increase your catch radius

- In-air body control

Justin O'Shea was not only blessed with great physical SIZE, but he plays the game with elite "size" as well. He's the greatest pass catcher of all time for many reasons but size has always been a factor. He "Moss's" people regularly and is often seen giving the "Too small" hand gesture afterwards.

*Honorable mention: Joe Labo*

### 6. Route Running

#### Kevin "Dingo" McCarthy

When Dingo puts his foot in the ground he pushes off with phenomenal power to create separation in his routes. He always knows where he’s supposed to be and makes his cuts super sharp when coming out of his breaks to give the quarterback a clear target to throw at. You don’t have to worry about Dingo being in the wrong spot or running the wrong route. His understanding of route concepts and the route tree make him a reliable pass catcher for every QB he’s played with. 

*Honorable mention: Ken Silver*

### 7. Slot Skills/Zone Awareness

#### Nick Geraci

Geraci is known for his play at QB but a lot of people forget that Nick has borderline Hall of Fame numbers at receiver. His specialty is the slot. He can find those soft spots against zone coverages and has such a great feel for when to sit down in those spots. Geraci has always been most dangerous coming off of motion because he uses the motion to see whether or not the defense is in man or zone. When coming off of motion, slot receivers have to be well versed in option routes and Geraci runs them to perfection. 

*Honorable mention: Johnny Vega*

### 8. Improvisational Techniques

#### Nick Muse

When the play breaks down, it’s critical for pass catchers to make their way BACK to the QB. Few players do this as well as Shoe. Shoe already does most of his damage in short yardage situations. So when the 5 count is reached and the QB is in scramble mode, Nick Muse is someone you must play tightly because he is already close to the QB and will beat you with his elite improv skills. 

*Honorable mention: Ray Sullivan*

### 9. Positional Versatility 

#### Jesus Arancibia

Where you line up on the field can help create a mismatch, and Jesus is a player who wears many hats on the offensive side of the ball.

He lines up in the backfield as a running threat as much as anyone in the league; but he also takes snaps in the slot, at center, and out wide. Because you never know wear he’s going to line up, most players end up giving Jesus a very soft cushion. This is something Jesus takes advantage of often.

*Honorable mention: John "Holmes" Suydam*

### 10. Hands

#### Justin "J.J." Vernillo 

Having great hands is the most important skill for a pass catcher to possess. J.J. Doesn’t drop the ball. Like ever! Low balls, high balls, bad balls, You name it. He’ll catch it. Even in the tightest and toughest windows he uses his elite strong hands to take the ball away from would be defenders. It just needs to be near him for him to bring it in. A sign of the league's best hands.
