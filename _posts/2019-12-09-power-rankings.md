### Shirley Estate Mothmanian Devils
Frank had a strange day on Sunday. The teams offense scored plenty and at times Frank was crazy accurate and sharp. But when targeting number 1 receiver Justin O’Shea, Frank struggled with his ball placement. The 2 still teamed up for 3 scores but it is odd to see Frank miss his favorite receiver so often. When targeting Ken silver Frank was absolutely perfect. Ken scored 4 times and could not be stopped. He is hands down this years Pre-Season MVP. Holmes took a lot of heat for taking Ken over guys like Maca And Ray Sullivan but that move is already looking like the steal of the year. Holmes himself had another up and down day on both sides of the ball. He had a huge TD grab showing off strong hands but also had multiple end zone drops. He had a huge pass break up on Dan Oshea (his nemesis) but then allowed a big play over the middle to Dan only 2 plays later. Holmes is doing a great job of getting open and creating separation, now he must start cashing in on his hard work. Side note- Justin Oshea had 3 interceptions. He knows that he needs to be this defenses anchor. Sunday he proved that he can still be a shut down corner. 

### Neighborhood Roadies
We finally got to see Ian Tully in action this Pre-Season and he did not disappoint. He was explosive. On a botched hand off, Ian Tully scooped the ball off the ground at the 50 yard line and made EVERYONE miss. It was a special play. Coach Shoe had yet another day of running crisp routes and flashing open in the middle of the field. Geraci showed some positive signs at receiver but still looked erratic at QB. I’m still not sure who this teams starting QB is. Ian Tully says they will use a multi QB system but who’s going to be the crunch time passer? Who’s the move the chains passer? My guess is that Tully himself ends up being that guy which is great for this team. Ian has the experience but I’d love to see him in more Pre-Season action to increase his rep-count going into game day. 

### Poospatuck Smokes
We only had coach Dan at this weeks scrimmage. He had a nice day. Big grab over the middle and a sick 4th and 20 throw to Ian Tully for a TD. If Dan can continue to show versatility this Pre-Season, he may have an even bigger impact than he had in last year’s championship run.

### Smith Point Captains
Nothing to report. Zero players again. It’s becoming an embarrassment to the league. Does anyone on this team (Other than Colin Tully) even care?
