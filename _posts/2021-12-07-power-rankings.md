### 4. Mothmen 
The good ole coach had a few curve balls thrown at him on draft night. He also threw a few of his own. Passing on JJ to go with former MVP Renzo was a shock to some experts but to me this was the right move for the franchise. Renzo has showed up to almost every scrimmage so far and been amazing. Last time we saw Renzo this motivated he won a championship. 

Holmes had his eye on Delmonte entering round 2 but saw him picked just 1 spot before the MothMen were on the clock. Instead he chose reliable veteran John Maca. One of the premier defenders in the league. 

Holmes had seen Matt King play only twice but clearly saw enough out of the rookie to make Matt his 3rd round selection. Matt King was picked over some big names. The pressure will be on to live up to those expectations. 

Another shocker took place in round 4. Holmes selected Josh over names like Dingo and Ray. Josh was productive as a pass rusher last season but this was the first time he was selected before the fifth and final round. Josh will have to add to the teams offensive game plan to justify this pick.

Ultimately Holmes gambled on the best arm in football. If Renzo has a repeat year of his 2018/2019 season, this could be a very dangerous team. The question is does he have the horses? 

### 3. Roadies 
Coach Shoe had no choice but to play the waiting game on draft night. Nick had 2 game plans on deck depending on what Coach Dan did with the 1st overall pick. Getting hall of famer Justin Oshea at #2 overall was a major win for the franchise. You can’t go wrong with selecting the greatest receiver and defender of all time. 

Round 2 was the gamble for Coach Shoe. Most experts thought we’d see Nick Geraci return to the Roadies with the 6th pick of the draft but Shoe did the smart thing and went with the best player available. The pick, Last years MVP Nick Delmonte. Pairing Delmonte and Justin would be ANY QBs dream. (Almost any) 

Geraci was still available at the top of the 3rd round. A dream scenario for the roadies but that dream came crashing down just 1 selection prior as The Smokes would select Geraci to play WR. Ken Silver was on at least 1 other teams radar as a potential QB so the pick made sense from a positional standpoint HOWEVER, 2nd round pick Nick Delmonte voiced his displeasure with the pick almost immediately. “Not my quarterback!” Said Delmonte as Ken Silver approached the podium. 

It’s to early to have a distraction like this. Ken hasn’t even thrown a pass. It will be up to Nick Muse to sort out this sticky situation before it becomes more costly. 

### 2. Smokes
Coach Dan did the unthinkable last Saturday night. With the 1st overall pick he drafted his bitter rival Frank Semisa. The man who has broken Dans heart more times than Dan has broken his own legs. The 3 time MVP looked shocked, afraid, and upset by the pick. But as the night went on and the draft unfolded, the quarterback grew pleasantly surprised.

J.J. Should have been a 1st rounder. When he fell to the 5th pick both Dan and Frank SPRINTED to the podium to make the pick.
Frank and J.J. were meant to play together. “I can’t wait! He’s the best to ever do it” said J.J. about QB Frank Semisa.

Round 3 is when Dan broke some hearts of his own selecting Nick Geraci to play WR for the Smokes. Last time Geraci was a full time WR on a Semisa led offense, He scored 3 receiving TDs and won a championship. The question is how will Geraci adjust to NOT being a QB? Can he be a top flight defender again? If he can repeat his 2016/2017 performance as a WR/CB he could play a major role for this team.

Jesus Arancibia was an animal last season as a rookie. No mock drafts had him falling to the 4th round. No mock drafts had Dingo falling to the 5th. Frank plans to use Jesus as his lead rusher and Dingo as his Center. The 2 most important positions in his offense. Both Jesus and Dingo will play with sizable chips on their shoulders after unnecessary draft night slides. 

This team is loaded at 1 through 5. The questions will be on defense and defense ONLY, As this team is likely to be an offensive juggernaut based on personnel and scheme. A big factor to watch will be how much of the reigns Dan hands over to Frank. 

### 1. Drivers
Colin Tully returned half of last year’s championship team. Round 1 saw him add a familiar face in brother Ian Tully. Ian was the unsung hero of TeamTully last year as he set the edge for Nick Delmonte’s rushing attack. Ian will have to do more than block for this years team if they want to repeat as champions. He will have to get back to what made him a former MVP. Arguably the best player in league history with the ball in his hands, We will need to see Ian make an explosive impact to justify being picked over names like J.J. and Delmonte.

Colin also returned Joe Labo. Joe had his best season in a few years with the Drivers last year. He was often a security blanket for QB Frank Semisa. Using his size and basketball background to box out defenders. But it was his impact on defense against the MothMen in the championship game that made him an easy pick for Colin this year. Joe never let the MothMen rushing attack gain traction as he clogged rush lanes. 

Ray Sullivan was finally set free from TeamDan when Colin Tully selected Ray in the 4th round. This was a huge pick for the Drivers as Rays positional flexibility makes him a perfect fit in Colin’s offense. Ray can be featured as a lead rusher, lead blocker, outside receiver, slot receiver, And even a part time quarterback. 

Colin also added cousin James McDermott in round 2 (a question mark as we have not seen him play) and veteran Johnay. The Drivers get the nod at the number 1 spot after draft night for bringing back key elements that resulted in last years success and adding new faces that could plug in the holes left by Frank Semisa and Nick Delmonte. 

### Stock up
John Maca.
Maca has played well so far this pre season. 
Well enough to convince Holmes that he is a true #1 WR. We always expect Maca to shine as a defender but his offense has blossomed so far this year. Always a reliable pass catcher, Maca has put up big numbers against GREAT players so far. It’s up to Renzo now to find a way to get Maca the ball in space. 

### Stock down
Dan Osheas playing time.
Dan has looked up and down so far this year but draft night fell so perfectly into Dans lap that it will be hard to keep any of his 5 draft picks off of the field. Dan could see some extended run on the sideline if things go according to plan

### Biggest question?
Ken vs Delmonte.
The Roadies seem to be on their way to a heavyweight brawl. The problem is that brawl is taking place between teammates Ken Silver and Nick Delmonte. Will Ken even get a chance at QB? Not if Delmonte has anything to say about it.

### Biggest surprise?
Draft night.
Best draft night ever right? Top to bottom no detail was missed. The draft had surprises, suspense, laughs, and even some crying! Thanks to everyone who made such an amazing night so special.
