I’ve waited a few weeks after the draft to give coaches and players an opportunity to gel. 

### Poospatuck Smokes
This is not the worst roster in the league. Justin and Ken Silver won a championship as one of the most dominant 1-2 punches in league history. They accounted for 9 out of 10 total TDs scored by TeamHolmes. But for some reasons the excuses on why this team COULDN’T get it done started on draft night. Dan finds himself in the same situation he was in last year. A team full of players who refuse to show up and get better. But Justin and Dan had to know when they selected Ray over Mike C and Jesus, Hardcore Johnny over Dingo and JohnAy over Matt that these were 3 players that had under 3 scrimmage appearances combined over the last 2 seasons. I don’t know who the QB of this team is. At this point it doesn’t matter who the pick is as long as they make a decision. This team doesn’t have a playbook yet. Justin and Ken know what it takes to win and they are failing. 

### Neighborhood Roadies
I don’t know if this team is better or worse than last year. They lost Maca and Dingo, they gained Mike C. I think Mike C fits this team well but Coach Shoe and I think very differently. Nick Geraci has been below average in game action this year. Geraci has turned the ball over at an ALARMING RATE. Not just with interceptions but with silly 4th down conversion decisions. Geraci has always been a consistent pass catcher. The combo of JJ and Geraci on the outside would elevate this teams ability to stretch the field. With Geraci and JJ out wide, Shoe in the slot and Esco at center this team has speed and home run ability. Mike C may not be the best QB in the league and he may not even be the best QB on his roster, BUT he’s the RIGHT QB for this team. I like what Mike has done catching the ball but he looked like an all star catching passes from Frank Semisa early in the season. He hasn’t put up those number since.

### Shirley Estate Mothmen
Holmes has clearly learned a lot from his time over the past 2 seasons with Frank Semisa. He’s practicing WINNING tendencies. His guys are showing up, they have a playbook and they are all on the same page. Renzo (who showed up to zero scrimmage action last year) has been outrageous. He can make all the throws and his escapeability from the pocket has embarrassed defensive linemen. Dingo has been one of the best players so far this year. He’s piling up catches every week but it’s the progress he’s made as a defender that has brought his game to a new level. Jesus looks to be a steal in the 3rd round. He has elite speed and shiftiness. This team has a defined game plan which we have not seen from TeamDan or TeamShoeEsco. They may not have elite talent across the board but they are working with what they have and they are playing great team football.

### Team Tully
This team has the most talent 1 through 6 in the league. No one can question that. But The most talented roster in the league hasn’t won the big game in nearly 3 seasons. They teams in previous seasons with the most talent have assumed that they were to good to fail and didn’t practice. This team has not fallen into that trap. We have seen every player on this squad including multiple 4 man practices and a full 5 man practice. Ian Tully has been dynamic with the ball in space. Labo has anchored the team’s defense. Delmonte has shown the explosiveness that makes him an elite deep threat. Tyler showed his ability to be a consistent underneath option. Colin showed that he can play every position in Frank’s offense. And Frank himself has been unstoppable at times. It won’t be easy for this team. They need to continue to get solid numbers and put in the work or we could see some regression. But if they follow the current game plan this team will be able to run, pass and defend at a high level.

### MVP of the Week:
##### *Ian Tully*

He’s done it as a pass catcher, blocker, coverage corner and defensive lineman. Ian has been all over the field!

### Biggest question of the week:
##### *What’s up with the Smokes?*

Excuses excuses excuses. That’s all we’ve heard. Either shake up the roster or deal with it. The pity party has to end at some point.

### Biggest surprise of the week:
##### *Rookie Play*

Jesus has been a force with the ball in his hands. On run plays he’s averaging over 5 yards per carry.

Matt has been putting in solid work EVERY SINGLE WEEK. I expect big things from this young man moving forward.
