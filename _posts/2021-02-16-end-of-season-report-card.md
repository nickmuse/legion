# Poospatuck Smokes

##### Frank's Analysis
At first glance the Smokes seemed to have earned an F for the 2020-2021 season, but the football season is about a lot more than just game day. Justin O'Shea, Dan O'Shea, and Ken Silver had some MONSTER scrimmages this year. They truly did work hard all year. In Justin’s first year as a starting QB, we saw what we should have expected... an up and down performance. His connection with Johnny Vega was great. The 2 hooked up on some incredible timing routes, and Justin had to fit those balls into tight windows. The problem for the Smokes was the decision to go with a strictly spread passing attack. They attempted to use Ken Silver and Dan O'Shea as outside receivers for most of the day. Those are two players who normally line up in the middle of the field. The team could have used more of a tight offensive line formation to try and create switches across the defense. During scrimmage action this year, we saw members of the Smokes use a three man line with pulling guards like Justin and Ken to block for a Johnny Vega led rushing attack. This was effective in scrimmages but not used on game day. On the defensive side of the ball, this team was simply over matched and unprepared for the Mothmen rushing attack. They could not shed blocks and were unable to move side to side to stop the run. Effort was certainly lacking and that’s not something we’ve ever seen from a Justin O'Shea lead team. 

##### Result
- 1-5 Defeat to the Shirley Estate Mothmen

# Neighborhood Roadies

##### Frank's Analysis
They barely lost the greatest game ever played. The admiration I have for what this team accomplished is immeasurable. I know it’s a loss, but it could have easily been a win. Geraci played well, and short of one big mistake, he had his team in position to win in overtime. Mike C was playing a new position and I think he established himself as the next great pass catching center. He ran routes with power and showed strong hands all day. Frank Semisa was quoted saying “Mike C was the toughest cover of my career today”.

That’s high praise from the G.O.A.T. Dan Esco was electric. He showed that despite limited scrimmage time, he was working on his own to stay in game shape. His routes were crisp and his hands were soft. Nick Muse was shifty all day long. Only four catches but two of them found the end zone. He created HUGE separation on his routes. Whenever he caught a ball, he left his defender in the dust. Matt didn’t have a huge impact on offense, but his ability on defense was on full display. He forced Joe Labo into some tough contested catches all day long. That leaves us with JJ. JJ is going to challenge Justin as the greatest receiver of all time when it’s all said and done. Ian blanketed JJ all day and JJ still walked away with over ten catches and two scores. He can not be covered one on one. Team Tully doubled JJ and he still found ways to get open and be effective. Has the kid ever dropped a ball? I don’t think he ever will. The Roadies have so much to be proud of. That game will go down in history as the greatest game ever played because it WAS the greatest game ever played. They could have won. If Frank would have thrown a interception instead of Nick Geraci throwing an interception, the Roadies would probably be celebrating their first championship. It was that close and this team deserves all the credit in the world for standing up to a power house roster and nearly slaying Goliath.

##### Result
- 5-6 Double OT Loss to Team Tully

# Shirley Estate Mothmen

##### Frank's Analysis
If I ever hear another person talk about the good ole coach as a joke again I’ll smack the shit out of them. Coach Holmes AS OF RIGHT NOW is the best and most creative coach in the league. Period. Holmes was always a motivational coach. A guy who could rally the troops. Now he’s an X’s and O’s tactician. He got two massive blows 24 hours before game day. His most reliable receiver all season long, Dingo, popped up on the COVID-19 list and his first round pick and starting (former MVP) QB Renzo suffered a broken hand. Down to 4fourplayers and unable to field a team for game day he was awarded Pac off of waivers. That’s when Holmes realized with 24 hours to go, he needed to re-work his entire playbook. He switched from a pass heavy attack anchored by the arm of Renzo to a run heavy attack featuring his best player and new starting QB Pac. He found creative ways to use Pacs speed and his own speed in the running game and this team finished 2nd in total rushing behind only TeamTully. Josh Paini was last seasons Patty Vega Breakout player of the year and somehow he broke out again. He took a four yard screen pass to the house with 50 yards of run after catch. Josh’s defense was simply legendary. He finished with an LOL record of three sacks. Maca didn’t have a huge role in the run first offense but was an elite defender all day. Why this team didn’t find ways to get Maca more involved on offense was thee only mistake Holmes made. Rookie Jesus Arancibia was an unbelievable addition to the league. He was targeted often and never disappointed. His deceptive speed made him a matchup nightmare from the center position. He’s going to be a great player in this league for years to come. Coach Holmes himself had his greatest game as a player in his nine year career. He simply did it all. Defended with heart and intensity, ran the ball with toughness on his way to two rushing TDs and even mixed it up with some great throws over the middle. Vegas odds had this team as huge first round underdogs after losing Renzo to injury, The good ole coach went to work and surprised everyone with a ballsy game plan.

##### Result
- 5-1 Win against the Poospatuck Smokes
- 0-5 Loss to Team Tully

# Team Tully

##### Frank's Analysis
I’ll keep it simple, Jim Tully and Lino Paini would have been proud of the boys on February 13th. They played with heart and fiery passion. They played for each other and 1 common goal. Despite limited practice time together they showed a certain cohesion that can only be described as a childhood connection. Ian, Colin and Frank may not have had the most time on the field in scrimmages this year but they’ve had years of throwing the football around in the backyard. Frank and Nick Delmonte grew up competing against each other and have always found ways to bring out the best in each other. Joe labo set the tone for this team all day. He was the defensive captain of this team for a reason. It was his call to stay in a man to man scheme all day and it paid off. On offense, he cleared the way for the number one rushing attack this season and as a pass catcher he shined. He was targeted 7 times and had 7 catches including some incredibly athletic “go up and get it” type plays. His calmness in the huddle kept QB Frank Semisa cool and comfortable all day. Ian Tully was an iron man. He guarded the other teams' best playmakers all day long no matter where they lined up. He made tough contested catches and was a force as a lead blocker. He did all the dirty work that doesn’t always show up in the stat sheet. The kind of work a team has to have to win a championship. He also still found a way to fill up the stat sheet with 1 sack, 10 catches, and 2 receiving TDs. Colin Tully was this teams true number 1 receiver. 3 receiving TDs was just the tip of the iceberg. Colin rivals JJ and Justin O'Shea as the best pure route runner in our league. When he sticks his foot in the ground to change direction, he creates more separation than ANYONE in the league. He made it easy on Frank Semisa all day. He capped it off with the championship winning catch and run down the right sideline for a TD. Frank Semisa was Frank semisa. He refused to make the big mistake as he went his 3rd straight game day without throwing an interception. He threw for six touchdowns and ran for one. He took what the defense gave him and never forced the issue. The unquestionable G.O.A.T. has now won his 7th championship in 9 years. Let’s take a little bit of time to think about that. You’d never know it but 

Nick Delmonte played a good portion of game day with a leg injury. It didn’t stop him for joining the most elite club in the league. He is now the 6th member of the Jim O'Shea MVP club. He had the most prolific rushing performance in league history, both in yards and TDs (3). He also caught a TD and he had the first ever defensive score in league history with his pick 6 of Nick Geraci. That’s 5 total TDs. Justin O'Shea is the only other non-QB to have 5 TDs in a Gameday. (He also won MVP that year). With his first championship win and first MVP award, he has officially thrown his hat into the ring for hall of fame consideration. Delmonte’s performance was gutsy and historic and knowing he was in a good amount of pain shows how badly he wanted to honor his father this season.

##### Result
- 6-5 Double OT Win against the Neighborhood Roadies
- 5-0 Shutout against the Shirley Estate Mothmen
