##### Frank's Analysis
A predictable end to a frustrating season for coach Dan. I still truly believe that this team had enough talent to compete but instead we saw a team that got down early and quit on their coach. The members of the Smokes can only blame themselves. The only player who consistently showed up to scrimmages was Coach Dan himself, and somehow he is going to be blamed for this team's failures.

First round selection Joe Labo did not have his best performance. He had a couple nice catches, he had a couple of nice throws; but ultimately the lack of practice, chemistry, and continuity showed. Poospatuck’s keeper, Renzo, had a similar year to his brother Joe. A handful of nice plays, but ultimately an underwhelming performance in comparison to his MVP Campaign last year. Ray Sullivan was one of the only players that did not quit on his coach. He fought play after play, but you could tell that the lack of practice hurt almost every player on this roster. JohnAy was himself. He found ways to get open, but the team could not cash in on any of those opportunities. Marc was finally able to register his first catch, however that was all we saw of him.

This team was bad offensively. This team was bad defensively. Ken Silver gashed this team for five catches and two touchdowns. Frank Semisa had only 4 incompletions in their match-up against him. The things that hurt most while watching this team was the direction that the fingers were pointed, the way that they seemed to quit on Dan, and the way that they seem to quit on each other.

##### Result
- 0-5 loss to the Shirley Estate Mothmanian Devils

##### Frank's Analysis

We were told over and over that this team did not need to practice. We were told over and over that this team had too much talent across the board to fail. In Johnny Vega’s final year as a coach we saw zero effort, zero accountability, zero preparation and zero heart.

First round draft selection Colin Tully had a great day with both a receiving and passing touchdown. However, the decision to go with Mike C at starting quarterback over Tully proved to be a fatal one. Mike C had a handful of great throws, including a beautiful deep shot to Nick Delmonte, but ultimately Mike C was far too inconsistent with his ball placement to get this team to the championship. Delmonte himself had another great game. He and Colin ran great routes all day and seemed to be open on every play. However, this did not result in points. Tyler scored a deep touchdown from Colin Tully and had a couple of key catches throughout the day.

This team would have been so much fun to watch had they practiced together at all this year, but unfortunately practice was not A priority for Coach Johnny.

##### Result
- 3-5 loss to the Neighborhood Roadies

##### Frank's Analysis

When co-coaches Shoe and Esco heard that they had lost their 1st round draft selection Ian Tully, they did not panic. They had seen plenty of JJ during the preseason and knew that they’d be getting a great player. JJ was the most impressive rookie that this league has EVER seen! He took over for not only a 1st round pick, but for perennial all-star Ian Tully. You would think that the pressure of replacing a hall-of-famer would rattle any rookie, but JJ was no ordinary rookie. He was this team’s unquestioned go-to option. He had 12 catches and 4 touchdowns. That’s a crazy big day for any player, but for a rookie it was simply legendary. Nick Muse had his best season yet. His 3 TD grabs were a career high. Esco tied his career high with 2 TD receptions. Shoe and Esco worked very well together as 50/50 coaches. Both had strong voices in the huddle and both commanded the respect of their teammates. Dingo and Maca both played well, but after watching the film it seems like they both went unnoticed by QB Nick Geraci. Both players were able to create separation all day, but neither had a big statistical impact.

That’s really the only complaint you can have about Geraci’s play. Other than failing to keep Maca and Dingo involved, he was pretty damn good. In game 1 he was almost perfect. He was calm, and took what the defense gave him. On the team's 4th point drive, he was at his absolute best. He went 6 for 6 on the touchdown drive with an almost exclusive hurry up offense. Geraci knows there are things he will need to clean up going into next season if he’s going to be a championship caliber QB, but overall I’d say he’s a step closer than I thought he’d be.

It’s hard to grade the Roadies' year. The problem is that there are no moral victories in this league. This team had championship aspirations and ultimately fell short. But with that being said, this team fought hard and competed on every play. This team has so much to be proud of, but they certainly had enough talent to win it all. I know that Shoe and Esco were rookie coaches but at the end of the day we are judged on wins and losses. The team made it to the big dance in year 1 of this experiment. Next year, anything short of winning a championship will be considered a complete failure.

##### Result
- 5-3 victory over the Smith Point Captains

##### Frank's Analysis

It was a long journey for coach Holmes to finally get his first ring as the head of a franchise. In his first year as a coach, his team blew a 2-0 lead late in the game to TeamFrank. In his second season, he made it out of the first round but lost 5-2 to TeamFrank again. Year 3 saw him eliminated in the 1st round with a last place finish.

With the first overall pick last year, he selected Frank Semisa. The man who had beaten him many times before. They both believed that together they could conquer the demons that seemed to haunt this franchise. After a tumultuous preseason, a trade request, and months of arguing; the team finished in last place for the second year in a row.

Going into THIS season, Coach Holmes refused to quit on the guys he felt worked hard for him. He used his keeper provision on Josh Paini. Josh had a nice rookie campaign and coach Holmes saw the potential. He brought back Frank Semisa. He took Justin O'Shea 1st overall. His patience paid off. Getting Frank and Justin on the same team had been a dream for coach Holmes, and he finally pulled it off. In round 3 coach Holmes had to make a difficult decision. Names on the board included John Maca and Ray Sullivan. Frank and Justin urged him to take a chance on Ken Silver. Holmes trusted his teammates and made the pick. This would prove to be the most important draft pick of the year.

This team put in the work at every single scrimmage. Franks historic “Audible Offense” is complex. The terminology can be difficult to comprehend, and much more difficult to master. This team studied and showed week after week that it was ready for game day.

A 5-0 victory over reigning champions, MVP Renzo and the Poospatuck Smokes, looked easy to this team. Ken silver had 5 catches and 2 scores. Frank Semisa was unstoppable. This offense scored every time they touched the ball. Including a beautiful goal line TD grab by Josh Paini.

In game 2, they beat the Roadies 5-3 by scoring on 5 out of 6 possessions. After back to back ringless seasons, Justin O'Shea came up huge with 3 TDs. Holmes himself, the man his teammates refer to as “The Good Ole Coach” had the play of the day with his late game interception of Nick Geraci.

This team was a cohesive unit from draft night to game day, and the hard work finally paid off for the good ole coach.
