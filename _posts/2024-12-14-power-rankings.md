### 4. Last of the Masticans 
In year one as a coach John Kossin drafted an incredibly talented unit. Especially considering he had the last pick of the draft. Justin Oshea and Colin Tully are members of the Roberto Arancibia Hall of Fame. Mateo Barahona is an exciting athletic rookie. Jesus Arancibia is one of the most consistent playmakers in L.O.L. Football. But we know the big question with this roster….Who is the starting QB? We’ve seen this dilema with other franchises in the past. It rarely works out. The good news is that they have options, Colin Tully won an MVP at the position. Joe Labo and Justin Oshea also have reps under their belts. But not knowing is not a good thing in this league. They have to figure it out and figure it out fast. Colin, Jesus, and Justin all made some great plays on Saturday. Colin flashed the speed, Justin flashed the size, And Jesus flashed the versatility. We know these guys can play. Now it’s up to Rookie coach John Kossin to put each of them in a position to win.



### 3. Poospatuck Smokes   
Unlike The Masticans, The Smokes have 2 options at QB. Coach Dan Oshea has been the starting QB for the smokes for the past 2 seasons and has played reasonably well. Lorenzo Labozetta is a 2 time MVP at the position, A member of the Roberto Arancibia Hall of Fame, and one of the 3 best players in L.O.L. history. This is a “Good” problem to have. Rookie Brendan McKnight has been making a huge impact early on this season and should be a factor in this offense no matter who throws. We’ve seen some of Wesley Sullivan this season (certainly more than last season) and some of Johnny Vega as well. Both players have looked solid. Just like the Smokes last season, We won’t know what this team really is until we see their best players on the field at the same time. And just like last season, That may not happen until game day.



### 2. Neighborhood Roadies
 Coach Nick Muse has ALWAYS shown loyalty to his guys. This years Roadies have a ton of familiar faces. Leading the charge is QB Nick Geraci who’s looked sharp early this season. The receiving core is a who’s who of L.O.L. talent. Ian Tully, James McDermott, Nick Delmonte, Kevin McCarthy, And of course the coach himself. Coach Shoe has picked up where he left off last season. He’s a football magnet and Saturdays scrimmage even saw the coach throw a TD pass. We won’t see McDermott and we won’t see Delmonte likely until game day but Shoe drafted enough guys that can be key contributors for 3 months until then. Ian, Kevin, and Matt Warner have all made big plays so far. Let’s see if coach Muse and QB Nick Geraci can finally get the monkey off of their backs!



### 1. Shirley Estate Mothmen
J.J. fell to the 2nd round again. And again the biggest beneficiary and happiest man on earth is QB Frank Semisa. Public service announcement to the league, J.J. Isn’t just a really good, fast, and Talented player. He’s one of the top 4 greatest players to ever grace this league. He’s on the Mt. Rushmore of L.O.L. Football. Not up for debate. We’ve seen key contributions from 7 out of 8 players on this roster so far this season. Matt King looked dominant in Saturdays action. Maca and Merrick have shown the ability to find the endzone, Ken has flown out from Tennessee to be a part of this roster and even the “Good Ole Coach” has made some big catches. Frank has been flawless as a passer but it’s his defense that coach Holmes has been surprised by. Frank said after the draft-“Holmes picking me as the #1 overall pick doesn’t just mean I have to be a great passer or leader, I’m expected to be a capable defender and I’m taking that job seriously”

So far he’s proving it. 

## Frank's Thoughts

### Stock Up ⬆️ 📈

-The L.O.L. Draft Party.

What an unreal and well attended tribute to our leagues history and future. A star studded event with unbelievable food, people, and outfits. It’s the best night of the year and shout out to John mother fuckin Maca for showing us how to play roulette like professionals!

### Stock down ⬇️📉

-Interceptions.

This could be a stock up for some players but so far through 4-5 weeks of scrimmages our QB’s have thrown an alarming amount of INTs. Hopefully guys can clean it up soon as they get acclimated to their respective rosters

### Cause for concern?

-Coach Kossin’s health.

The rookie coach tried to power through what appeared to be a significant back injury but couldn’t give it 100%. Rest up Coach, The boys are gonna need you!

### Week 1 MVP

-J.J.

Kid's my actual hero. No cleats. Unguardable. 

When he’s covered he’s open. When he’s open he’s open. His feel for how deep to run his routes and his ability to track the deep ball are the best ever. Even with a smaller wingspan he still has one of the largest catch radius’s I’ve ever seen. He can go way up top for a ball, and he can pick them off the turf. On draft night he said “Just get me the ball” and that seems like a no brainer for anyone throwing to him.
