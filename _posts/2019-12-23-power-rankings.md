1-TeamHolmes
I’ve said a lot about the pros and cons of this roster. Yesterday showed that I was half wrong and half right about this team. The offense was brilliant yet again. Frank had his best day at QB so far this preseason which is saying a lot because he’s been great all year. Frank checked off every box you want to see,
A. Throws with anticipation and accuracy ✅
B. Shows elite arm strength ✅
C. Shows ability to maneuver in the pocket ✅
D. Shows ability to take of and run ✅
He did it all. Ken Silver battled flu like symptoms all week. Not only did he show up but he showed out. He came up with a big TD grab in the back of the end zone and scored on a pick 6. Ken showed his warrior mentality yesterday and his teammates really appreciated that he gave it everything he had. Coach Holmes had the best game of his entire football career. His defense was solid and even had an interception that he took the distance for a TD. He had ZERO drops for the first time all year. He snuck into the end zone on offense with a 3 yard grab. Josh had his best day of the year as well. He was dynamic on offense and showed the ability to play multiple positions. He also showed up on defense. Defensive captain Justin Oshea asked Josh to line up against top tier talent and Josh accepted the challenge. Justin Oshea continued showing his defensive ability with another 3 interception day. Now if this team can play defense like this on game day they will be a tough out. The offense has already been unstoppable at times and if the defense can win man to man matchups, They will be scary. 

2-TeamShoe/Esco
Interesting day all around for this squad. Almost everyone got a shot a QB. This makes sense as we know that Ian Tully likes to use a multi-QB system to keep the defense guessing. Problem is that no one really stood out yesterday as a great passer. Ian and Geraci the 2 most likely candidates, had highs and lows. They were intercepted 5 TIMES. You just can’t turn the ball over like that an expect to win. I completely understand that the plan is to keep the defense off balance by throwing different pre snap looks. That strategy has worked for Ian last year with TeamDan. But that TeamDan had a true starter in Renzo who could bail the team out because he was the unquestioned “Go-to” QB. Right now this team doesn’t know who that guy is. At some point this year someone is going to have to start taking meaningful preseason snaps. Even if the plan is to have everyone play QB, I’d still love to see them dedicate an entire scrimmage  to one QB. Let someone go the whole day, Good or bad. Let’s see how someone battles through adversity. Let’s see how someone reacts to the pressure of being “The guy”. Because on game day, you need a person that has the necessary reps and confidence to take over in key situations. On a positive note Shoe, Esco and Dingo were all great. Dingo seemed to catch 100 balls. He was everywhere. His deceptive speed and shiftiness make him an excellent mid-range target. Esco hauled in 2 beautiful deep passes. He has enough length to make contested 50/50 catches. Who ever plays QB is getting a great receiving core. 

3-TeamJohnny
We finally got to see Coach Johnny in action. He caught a beautiful pass on an out-route and was able to turn up field for positive yardage. We saw a lot of Colin Tully and his full repertoire was on display. He caught a 60 yard bomb from Frank Semisa on a deep post and then threw a 60 yard bomb to Justin Oshea later that day. I’d still love to see more players from this squad. The rumor is that this team has finally activated Mike C off of injured reserve and he will be available to play next week. 

4-TeamDan
DAN OSHEA SHOWS UP EVERY SINGLE WEEK! And he deserves a ton of credit for the effort he puts in. But his team is failing him. This team simply isn’t talented enough to get away with zero practice time together. JohnAy did show up and did play great. He had a really nice touch pass in the back of the end zone to Justin Oshea. Renzo HAS to start showing up and taking charge of his teammates the same way he did last season. He played in almost every scrimmage last year and developed great chemistry with his guys. We have not seen that level of dedication so far this season from last years MVP
