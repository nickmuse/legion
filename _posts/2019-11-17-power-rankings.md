### Shirley Estate Mothmanian Devils
This is NOT the team with the most talent. This team does NOT have a good defense. This team does NOT have elite speed. This team DOES have Frank Semisa and Justin Oshea. And at Sunday’s scrimmage the duo reminded everyone who they are and how dangerous the two of them playing together can be. Frank hit Justin for 3 touchdowns and 2 of them were full field scores. Let’s not forget Ken silver who also had 3 scores. While this team doesn’t have the desired outside speed teams want to have, it has 2 big targets in Justin and Ken. Josh P had some bright moments but must clean up some of his drops for this offense to look complete. The bad news is the this defense is still very much a question mark. The good news is that Semisa’s offense already appears to be installed. The team was well prepared and seemed to have a firm grasp on the playbook. This is pretty impressive considering we are only one week removed from draft night.

### Smith's Point Captains
Only one TeamJohnny player showed up to Sunday’s scrimmage and it happened to be TeamJohnnys best player. Colin Tully was outstanding at QB. He hasn’t played the position in years so the rust was evident but he showed why he’s a hall of fame player and why he’s a former MVP. His 70 yard bomb to John Maca was the highlight of the day. Under duress, on 4th and long, Colin Tully did what Colin Tully does. He alluded the pass rush set his feet and threw a ball to a spot where only his man could make a play. TeamJohnny has slipped from the #1 spot to the #2 spot because I need to see more than just Colin out there. We know that on paper this team has all the talent. The question is whether or not coach Johnny can lead and organize them.

### Neighborhood Roadies
TeamShoe/Esco had a great turn out on Sunday. They had 5 of 6 players on the field. If you weren’t sure about John Maca’s status as a legit #1 WR you better be sure now. He’s a SUPERstar. He beat every defender thrown at him. He beat Frank, Colin, Justin and everyone else. The big question is who is going to throw him the ball. Geraci had a chance to prove he’s the guy today and he responded to the opportunity with an up and down performance. He made some great throws and got into a good rhythm but didn’t quite do enough to truly solidify himself as the teams starter. QB is important to have when guys like Maca can take over a game. This team needs to figure out who that guy is. Having an offensive identity and an overall scheme will be much easier when personnel is set.

### Poospatuck Smokes
TeamDan had one player show up to Sunday’s scrimmage. That player was coach Dan himself. The good news is that Dan looked good. He made some nice catches and looked pretty sharp at QB in some limited action. The bad new is that there is no other information to report. I think this team can be good in spite of all the glaring holes. But with a lack of speed on the outside, the only way for this offense to be effective will be a lot of timing routes and a lot of anticipation throws. Unfortunately for TeamDan this requires practice and repetition. Last year TeamDan had solid numbers at every scrimmage. Let’s hope that coach Dan can get his guys to show up and get to work next week. Let’s not forget that this team has replaced Ian with Joe Labo, John Maca with JohnA, and Nick muse with Marc. With all these sweeping changes to last year’s championship roster, it will be up to coach Dan to put all the new pieces in the best place to to be successful.
