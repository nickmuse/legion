# Legends of Legion Rulebook
  
## Pre-Game

The right to call heads or tails during the coin toss will be decided by previous year‘s record. As "home" team and "away" team will be named. Away team picks heads or tails.

## Line of Scrimmage

Any amount of player may be called into motion before the snap.

Only one player may still be in motion at the snap.

## Pre-Snap

Substitutions may be made by offense at any time.

Defending team may ask for a defensive stop for an equal opportunity to make a substitution.

Pre-snap huddle should not total more than 25 seconds. This may result in a 2 yard penalty at the Referees' discretion.

Too many players in the huddle (6 or more players) will result in a 2 yard penalty.

False Start will result in a 2 yard penalty.

## Snap

Snap must be between the legs.

The offensive player who receives the snap is considered the QB and can not scramble until rushed.

## Rushing & Scrambling

Count will be done by Referee.

Count is 5 seconds by default.

After the count, defensive players may pass the line of scrimmage cone.

When a defensive player passes the line of scrimmage cone, the QB may scramble.

Defenders may cross the line prior to the end of count if the ball leaves the QB's hands (Hand-off, Pass, Fumble etc.)

If a defensive player rushes before the count, it will result in an offsides penalty. They must then retreat behind the line of scrimmage cone (regaining a legal guarding position) and wait for the count. QB gets a “Free play” and may scramble as soon as defender passes cone at any point. 5 yard penalty applied.

## Boundaries

Outer most edge of cone is considered out of bounds.

The fence is out. If any ball or player's body part touches the fence, the ball or player will be ruled out of bounds.

If an out of bounds player makes any contact with the ball, the ball is considered out of bounds. Possession does not have to be established.

## Turnovers

Interceptions may be returned

Fumbles may not be returned. Ball is down at spot of clear recovery
 
## Tagging

If a potential tagger is on the ground or out of bounds, they are not in legal tagging position.

Illegal taggers must get up and establish legal position before making a tag.

A tag in end zone will result in a loss of downs and the ball will be placed at the 1 inch line. (No Safety)

## Other Contact

The bump zone for defenders to put hands on an offensive player is within the first 2 yards off of the line of scrimmage.

If the ball carrier hits the ground at any point he is considered down by contact.

Holding must be clear and obvious. This means grabbing a player outside of the shoulders. Anything inside of the shoulders is a legal block, even if grabbed.

Defensive pass interference must be clear and obvious. Results in a spot foul and re-do of downs unless the play gains enough penalty yardage to result in a 1st down.

Offensive pass interference must be clear and obvious (pick play or push off) will result in a 5 yard penalty and loss of down.

## Kicking

During 4th down, the possessing team may opt to kick.

Teams may not kick unless they opt to.

Kicks may be faked.

During an opt to Kick:
- Count is 3 seconds.
- Pass interference and illegal contact are not possible.

## Scoring & Overtime

Halftime begins when either team reaches 3 points.

Games are played until one team reaches 5 points, unless overtime is active  

A 4-4 score at any point will result in immediate overtime.  

Overtime rules are a redemption style point system.

## Timeout

Each team has 3 time outs per half. Time outs may be called at any time and may be called consecutively.

## Rules

Only team coaches and one coach-appointed captain can petition referees.

During a timeout, any player may speak to the referees.

NFL rulebook is default rule book when a rule or call is not covered in the LOL rulebook.  

Plays are reviewable to a reasonable extent. This includes NFL rulebook check if necessary. Calls and rulings can be changed.
